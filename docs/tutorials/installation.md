#### Windows Smartscreen popup
You may encounter Windows Smartscreen ("Windows protected your PC"), mdpkm is not yet signed so you will have to work around this.

Click the "More info" button in the top left corner, and then click "Run anyway" in the bottom right corner.

#### Continue
Once the installer opens, pretend it's cookie clicker and click "Next" over and over.
